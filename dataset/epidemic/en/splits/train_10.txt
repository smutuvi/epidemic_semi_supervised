NICE O
calculates O
that O
Jevtana O

been O
shown O
to O
increase O
overall O
survival O
by O
more O

NICE O
questions O
whether O

clearly O
undermines O
the O

” O
The O

wants O
the O

it O

Furthermore O

the O

also O
ensure O
all O

have O
an O
unannounced O
inspection O
once O
a O

My O
priorities O
are O
clear O
: O
improve O
and O
protect O
health O
and O
reduce O
inequalities O
through O
prevention O
; O
improve O
the O
quality O
of O

and O
outcomes O
for O
patients O
, O
clients O
and O

; O
develop O
more O
innovative O
, O
accessible O
and O
responsive O
services O
, O
promoting O
choice O
and O
making O
more O
services O
available O
in O
the O
community O
; O
involve O
individuals O
, O
communities O
and O
the O
independent O
sector O
in O
the O
design O
, O
delivery O
and O
evaluation O
of O
services O
; O
improve O
productivity O
by O
ensuring O
effective O
and O
efficient O
allocation O
and O
utilisation O
of O
available O
resources O
; O
and O
ensure O
that O
we O
look O
after O
the O
most O
vulnerable O
in O
our O
society O
and O
the O
children O
, O
the O
future O
for O
this O
country O
. O

To O
meet O
this O
challenge O
we O
must O
stop O
doing O
what O
does O
not O
work O
, O
challenge O
out O
of O
date O
practices O
and O
acknowledge O
that O
some O
services O
are O
no O
longer O
fit O
for O
purpose O
. O

There O
is O
no O
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" O
do O
nothing O
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" O
option O
. O

To O
continue O
as O
we O
are O
would O
leave O
us O
with O
an O
unsustainable O
service O
, O
with O
consequences O
for O
patient O
care O
and O
safety O
. O

This O
is O
why O
I O
commissioned O
this O
review O
. O

I O
asked O
for O
a O
blueprint O
for O
reform O
. O

I O
laid O
down O
a O
challenge O
to O
the O
review O
team O
: O
to O
examine O
the O
future O
provision O
of O
services O
, O
including O
our O
acute O
hospital O
configuration O
, O
the O
development O
of O
primary O
healthcare O
services O
and O
social O
care O
and O
the O
interface O
between O
sectors O
to O
meet O
our O
priorities O
. O

This O
review O
is O
not O
about O
cost O
cutting O
. O

It O
is O
about O
quality O
, O
accessibility O
and O
safety O
of O
patient O
care O
. O

As O
the O
financial O
situation O
tightens O
, O
there O
needs O
to O
be O
a O
radical O
shift O
in O
where O
and O
how O
that O
money O
is O
used O
. O

I O
am O
not O
naive O
. O

I O
have O
always O
known O
that O
the O
review O
would O
make O
recommendations O
that O
will O
be O
challenging O
and O
I O
will O
not O
shirk O
hard O
decisions O
. O

However O
, O
commissioning O
this O
review O
was O
not O
a O
difficult O
decision O
. O

Indeed O
, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
irresponsible O
of O
me O
not O
to O
do O
so O
in O
light O
of O
the O
issues O
facing O
us O
. O

The O
proposals O
in O
this O
report O
represent O
radical O
change O
, O
which O
will O
provide O
a O
more O
citizen O
focused O
and O
effective O
health O
service O
. O

The O
evidence O
collected O
through O
engagement O
with O
more O
than O
3,000 O
people O
speaks O
for O
itself O
. O

Our O
people O
feel O
that O
improvements O
are O
necessary O
. O

The O
review O
proposes O
a O
model O
which O
places O
the O
individual O
at O
its O
centre O
. O

Health O
and O
social O
care O
services O
will O
be O
increasingly O
accessible O
in O
local O
areas O
. O

Patients O
will O
deal O
with O
fewer O
professionals O
and O
will O
be O
at O
the O
centre O
of O
decision O
making O
about O
their O
treatment O
. O

There O
will O
be O
a O
significant O
shift O
from O
provision O
of O
services O
in O
hospitals O
to O
provision O
of O
services O
in O
the O
GP O
surgery O
, O
closer O
to O
home O
, O
where O
it O
is O
safe O
and O
effective O
to O
do O
this O
. O

Services O
will O
regard O
home O
as O
the O
hub O
and O
ensure O
that O
people O
can O
be O
cared O
for O
at O
home O
, O
including O
at O
the O
end O
of O
life O
. O

Where O
specialist O
hospital O
care O
is O
required O
it O
will O
be O
available O
with O
patients O
being O
discharged O
into O
the O
care O
of O
local O
services O
as O
soon O
as O
their O
health O
and O
care O
needs O
permit O
. O

The O
review O
proposes O
hospitals O
will O
work O
as O
a O
system O
, O
with O
each O
facility O
contributing O
to O
the O
provision O
of O
a O
total O
service O
to O
its O
population O
. O

This O
will O
mean O
change O
in O
all O
sites O
over O
a O
five O
year O
period O
. O

A O
key O
aspect O
of O
this O
approach O
is O
that O
critical O
clinical O
staff O
will O
be O
employed O
to O
work O
in O
a O
hospital O
system O
and O
will O
be O
a O
resource O
for O
each O
population O
working O
as O
necessary O
across O
hospital O
services O
and O
facilities O
. O

The O
review O
envisages O
change O
at O
several O
of O
the O
current O
acute O
hospital O
sites O
it O
suggests O
a O
likely O
position O
, O
over O
time O
, O
of O
five O
to O
seven O
major O
acute O
hospital O
networks O
in O
Northern O
Ireland O
. O

However O
, O
the O
key O
test O
for O
any O
future O
service O
configuration O
has O
to O
be O
sustainability O
and O
resilience O
in O
clinical O
terms O
. O

It O
will O
be O
on O
that O
basis O
that O
we O
are O
able O
to O
determine O
whether O
an O
acute O
hospital O
is O
viable O
. O

I O
recognise O
fully O
the O
need O
for O
greater O
productivity O
from O
the O
resources O
available O
to O
us O
, O
particularly O
in O
these O
times O
of O
austerity O
, O
and O
it O
is O
in O
that O
context O
that O
I O
firmly O
believe O
that O
the O
greater O
involvement O
of O
frontline O
professionals O
in O
decision O
making O
and O
service O
development O
is O
essential O
. O

Local O
commissioning O
, O
too O
, O
has O
a O
crucial O
and O
powerful O
role O
to O
play O
in O
driving O
change O
and O
innovation O

At O
this O
point O
, O
whether O
Novartis O
can O
avoid O
a O
lengthy O

is O
very O
unclear O
. O

The O
problems O
the O
FDA O
cited O
in O
the O
inspection O
report O
were O
so O
disturbing O
that O
the O
agency O
used O
capital O
letters O
and O
a O
bold O
font O
to O
emphasize O
that O
a O
pattern O
of O
problems O
existed O
. O

These O
problems O
included O
failures O
to O
respond O
to O
consumer O
complaints O
about O
bottles O
containing O
incorrect O
tablets O
, O
file O
reports O
with O
the O

that O
further O

be O
examined O
( O
here O

the O
FDA O

) O
. O

The O
drugmaker O
did O
not O
help O
it O
cause O
by O
insisting O
the O
problems O
were O
beyond O
its O
control O
, O
even O
though O
the O
FDA O
noted O
plant O

failed O
to O
properly O
investigate O
many O
complaints O
and O
could O
not O
present O
any O
evidence O
to O
justify O
its O
conclusion O
. O

Moreover O
, O
the O
shutdown O
and O
subsequent O
recall O
came O
shortly O
after O
the O
FDA O
sent O
a O
warning O
letter O
to O
Novartis O
about O
manufacturing O
problems O
at O
three O
plants O
run O
by O
its O
Sandoz O
generic O
drug O
unit O
( O
look O
here O
) O
. O

It O
’s O
hard O
to O
avoid O
the O
conclusion O
that O
the O
FDA O
is O
searching O
for O
system O
issues O
and O
still O
other O
plants O
are O
going O
to O
be O
scrutinized O
. O

The O
worst O
case O
scenario O
is O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
a O
lengthy O
shutdown O
and O
possibly O
still O
more O
, O
depending O
upon O
how O
the O
FDA O
proceeds O
. O

Then O
there O
is O
the O
prospect O
of O
a O
consent O
decree O
. O

Remember O
that O
the O
FDA O
has O
pursued O
this O
step O
recently O
with O
Johnson O

Johnson O

that O

No O
one O

it O
may O
come O
to O
this O
, O

the O
sort O

If O
any O

, O
the O
first O
assumption O

that O
it O

this O

about O

But O
now O
in O
Colombo B-LOC
, O
of O
10 O
children O
with O

, O
we O
should O
suspect O
that O
five O
