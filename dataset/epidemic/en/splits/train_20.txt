I O
do O
have O
to O
admit O

, O
even O
at O

I O
did O
rather O

Of O
course O
, O
more O
than O
thirty O

, O
I O
now O
realize O
that O
it O
was O
rather O
silly O
to O
have O
such O
hostility O
towards O
disco O
. O

Heck O
, O
these O
days O
I O
even O
kind O

like O
a O
fair O
amount O
of O
old O
1970s O

In O
retrospect O
, O
I O
rather O
suspect O
that O
the O
whole O
hating O

thing O
was O
just O
part O
of O
my O
identity O
at O
the O

, O
a O
convenient O
bit O
of O

Be O
that O
as O
it O
may O
, O
at O

I O
really O
, O
really O
, O
really O
, O
really O
hated O
the O
Bee O

, O
who O
to O
me O
epitomized O
everything O
that O
I O
thought O
was O
wrong O
with O
music O
at O
the O
time O
. O

These O
days O
, O
I O
actually O
own O
the O
soundtrack O
for O
Saturday O
Night O
Fever O
, O
something O
unimaginable O
to O
me O
33 O
years O
ago O
. O

However O
, O
even O
during O
my O
most O
disco O
hating O
, O
Bee O
Gees O
hating O
phase O
, O
I O
wouldn’t O
have O
wished O
what O
what O
’s O
happened O
to O
Robin O
Gibb O
on O
him O
. O

It O
appears O
to O
have O
begun O
in O
2010 O
, O
when O
he O
was O
taken O
for O
emergency O
surgery O
for O
a O
bowel O
obstruction O
. O

Over O
the O
next O
several O
months O
Gibb O
looked O
increasingly O
frail O
and O
gaunt O
, O
so O
much O
so O
that O
I O
was O
shocked O
by O
a O
couple O
of O
the O
photos O
I O
saw O
of O
him O
. O

In O
April O
2011 O
, O
he O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
hospital O
with O
what O
were O
described O
by O
“ O
crippling O
” O
abdominal O
pain O
. O

Finally O
, O
in O
November O
, O
the O
cause O
of O
Gibb O
’s O
declining O
health O
was O
finally O
revealed O
, O
when O
it O
was O
announced O
that O
he O
had O
been O
diagnosed O
with O
liver O
cancer O
and O
that O
he O
wasn’t O
responding O
to O
treatment O
: O
Fears O
were O
growing O
for O
frail O
Bee O
Gees O
star O
Robin O
Gibb O
last O
night O
as O
he O
battled O
liver O
cancer O
. O

The O
stricken O
singer O
, O
61 O
, O
was O
given O
the O
devastating O
news O
the O
disease O
was O
getting O
worse O
after O
months O
of O
treatment O
failed O
to O
have O
an O
effect O
. O

He O
is O
being O
cared O
for O
at O
home O
by O
devoted O
wife O
Dwina O
while O
brother O
and O
bandmate O
Barry O
, O
64 O
, O
has O
flown O
in O
from O
the O
US O
to O
be O
by O
his O
side O
. O

A O
family O
friend O
said O
: O
“ O
We O
are O
all O
devastated O
. O

“ O
Robin O
has O
been O
a O
pinnacle O
of O
strength O
and O
is O
showing O
enormous O
courage O
and O
dignity O
in O
the O
wake O
of O
this O
terrible O
news O
. O
” O
The O
star O
— O
who O
has O
been O
painfully O
thin O
for O
months O
— O
has O
bravely O
told O
friends O
and O
family O
he O
wants O
to O
“ O
work O
until O
I O
drop O
” O
. O

Presumably O
, O
Gibb O
has O
hepatocellular O
cancer O
( O
HCC O
) O
, O
which O
is O
what O
is O
usually O
meant O
by O
“ O
liver O
cancer O
. O
” O
Not O
knowing O
any O
more O
details O
than O
what O
are O
contained O
in O
the O
various O
news O
reports O
, O
it O
’s O
hard O
for O
me O
to O
comment O
with O
any O
degree O
of O
certainty O
on O
Gibb O
’s O
condition O
, O
but O
we O
can O
make O
some O
inferences O
. O

First O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
Gibb O
hasn’t O
undergone O
surgery O
. O

This O
implies O
that O
, O
at O
the O
very O
minimum O
the O
cancer O
is O
unresectable O
, O
and O
it O
’s O
probably O
metastatic O
. O

I O
say O
it O
’s O
“ O
probably O
” O
metastatic O
because O
there O
is O
another O
treatment O
option O
for O
unresectable O
HCC O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
discussed O
it O
in O
considerable O
detail O
in O
the O
context O
of O
Steve O
Jobs O
’ O
liver O
metastases O
from O
his O
neuroendocrine O
tumor O
of O
the O
pancreas O
. O

That O
treatment O
is O
liver O
transplantation O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
results O
for O
liver O
transplantation O
as O
a O
treatment O
can O
be O
quite O
good O
, O
certainly O
better O
than O
the O
results O
for O
Jobs O
’ O
neuroendocrine O
tumor O
, O
but O
patient O
selection O
is O
key O
. O

Be O
that O
as O
it O
may O
, O
given O
that O
news O
reports O
indicate O
that O
Gibb O
has O
undergone O
several O
rounds O
of O
chemotherapy O
, O
we O
can O
pretty O
safely O
assume O
that O
Gibb O
’s O
tumor O
was O
neither O
resectable O
nor O
amenable O
to O
liver O
transplantation O
and O
therefore O
is O
almost O
certainly O
metastatic O
, O
which O
means O
, O
if O
I’m O
correct O
, O
it O
’s O
not O
curable O
. O

One O
should O
note O
, O
however O
, O
that O
“ O
not O
curable O
” O
doesn’t O
mean O
“ O
not O
treatable O
. O
” O
Palliation O
is O
very O
, O
very O
important O
. O

Unfortunately O
for O
Gibb O
, O
I O
see O
another O
celebrity O
alt O
med O
tragedy O
fast O
approaching O
. O

The O
first O
indications O
came O
in O
November O
, O
not O
long O
after O
Gibb O
’s O
diagnosis O
was O
announced O
: O
Gibb O
’s O
wife O
, O
Dwina O
Murphy O
Gibb O
, O
an O
ordained O
druid O
priestess O
, O
said O
in O
an O
interview O
with O
Sky O
Arts O
TV O
that O
she O
’s O
looking O
into O
alternative O
treatments O
for O
her O
husband O
, O
including O
“ O
spider O
medicine O
, O
” O
a O
type O
of O
Native O
American O

approach O

spider O

a O

which O
refers O

“ O

” O
“ O

best O
I O
can O

“ O

, O
there O
may O
be O
psychosocial O
benefits O
in O

context O

” O
I O
pride O
myself O
in O
being O
aware O
of O
pretty O
much O
all O
forms O
of O
alternative O

but O
I O
must O
admit O
that O
I’ve O
never O
heard O
of O
“ O
spider O
medicine O
” O
before O
. O

So O
I O
went O
to O
the O
source O
, O
which O
tells O
me O
that O
spider O
medicine O
represents O
“ O
creativity O

: O
Spider O
Medicine O
represents O
creativity O

represent O
the O

Its O
body O
is O
in O
the O
shape O
of O
an O
8 O

which O
represents O
infinite O
possibilities O
. O

“ O
Spider O
people O
” O
must O
look O
beyond O
the O
web O
of O
illusion O
of O
the O
physical O
world O
and O
look O
beyond O
the O
horizon O
to O
other O
dimensions O
. O

Gibb O
’s O
wife O
apparently O
was O
convinced O
that O
this O
Native O
American O
“ O
medicine O
” O
can O
result O
in O
recovery O
from O
untreatable O
illnesses O
. O

But O
what O
is O
it O
? O

The O
source O
didn’t O
tell O
me O
much O
; O
so O
I O
went O
to O
the O
almighty O
Google O
. O

it O
didn’t O
tell O
me O
much O
either O
, O
other O
than O
that O
spider O
medicine O
is O
apparently O
some O
sort O
of O
spiritual O
treatment O
. O

Robin O

encouraged O

minute O

What O
irritates O
me O
about O
this O
article O
is O
not O
so O
much O
that O
Gibb O
is O
undergoing O
naturopathic O
treatment O
. O

He O
’s O
dying O
; O
he O
’s O
desperate O
; O
he O
has O
a O
wife O
is O
is O
, O
to O
put O
it O
kindly O
, O
very O
prone O
to O
woo O
. O

What O
would O
be O
amazing O
is O
if O
he O
managed O
to O
stick O
to O
science O
based O
treatment O
for O
palliation O
. O

He O
’s O
also O
incredibly O
wealthy O
; O
so O
the O
usual O
complaint O
of O
quacks O
sucking O
down O
the O
last O
money O
of O
a O
dying O
man O
doesn’t O
apply O
as O
much O
as O
it O
usually O
does O
. O

And O
, O
make O
no O
mistake O
, O
“ O
naturopathic O
oncology O
” O
is O
quackery O
, O
just O
as O
naturopathy O
is O
. O

For O
one O
thing O
, O
homeopathy O
is O
part O
and O
parcel O
of O
naturopathy O
. O

More O
importantly O
, O
there O
is O
no O
quackery O
that O
naturopaths O
don’t O
embrace O
. O

“ O
Energy O
healing O
, O
” O
“ O
detox O
” O
woo O
, O
unscientific O
use O
of O
supplements O
, O
these O
are O
just O
a O
few O
of O
the O
sorts O
of O
pseudoscience O
naturopaths O
embrace O
enthusiastically O
. O

What O
irritates O
me O
is O
the O
typical O
reporter O
lazily O
buying O
into O
the O
spin O
that O
naturopaths O
put O
on O
their O
quackery O
that O
“ O
good O
nutrition O
” O
can O
stimulate O
the O
body O
’s O
natural O
ability O
to O
heal O
itself O
, O
even O
to O
the O
point O
of O
healing O
an O
advanced O
malignancy O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
from O
what O
I O
can O
tell O
reading O
about O
Robin O
Gibb O
’s O
desperate O
situation O
, O
it O
’s O
fairly O
clear O
that O
he O
’s O
unlikely O
to O
make O
it O
through O
2012 O
, O
all O
the O
“ O
stayin O
’ O
alive O
” O
puns O
being O
bandied O
about O
nothwithstanding O
. O

It O
’s O
also O
clear O
that O
, O
contrary O
to O
what O
proponents O
of O
“ O
natural O
healing O
” O
tell O
us O
, O
eating O
the O
“ O
right O
” O
diet O
is O
no O
guarantee O
that O
you O
won’t O
get O
cancer O
. O

Multiple O
reports O
state O
that O
Gibb O
is O
a O
vegan O
and O
a O
teetotaler O
. O

Failure O
of O
cancer O
prevention O
notwithstanding O
, O
having O
a O
posse O
of O
naturopaths O
plying O
Gibb O
with O
their O
quackery O
isn’t O
helping O
matters O
. O

We O
can O
only O
hope O
that O
it O
doesn’t O
actually O
hasten O
his O
end O
. O

When O
that O
end O
comes O
, O
I O
predict O
that O
we O
will O
hear O
precious O
little O
about O
it O
from O
Mike O
Adams O
, O
Joe O
Mercola O
, O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
“ O
natural O
cancer O
cure O
” O
cranks O
infesting O
the O
Internet O
. O

Mike O
Adams O
is O
well O
known O
for O
gloating O
over O
the O
deaths O
of O
celebrities O
from O
cancer O
( O
for O
instance O
, O
Patrick O
Swayze O
and O
Tony O
Snow O
) O
as O
“ O
proof O
” O
that O
“ O
chemo O
kills O
. O
” O
Actually O
, O
on O
second O
thought O
, O
I O
bet O
we O
will O
hear O
about O
it O
from O
Adams O
. O

The O
reason O
is O
that O
Gibb O
has O
reportedly O
undergone O
seven O
rounds O
of O
chemotherapy O
. O

That O
will O
give O
Adams O
the O
opening O
he O
needs O
to O
claim O
that O
it O
was O
the O
chemotherapy O
that O
killed O
Gibb O
and O
that O
, O
by O
the O
time O
Gibb O
listened O
to O
his O
druid O
priestess O
wife O
and O
turned O
to O
“ O
natural O
healing O
” O
it O
was O
“ O
too O
late O
” O
because O
the O
chemotherapy O
had O
already O
“ O
destroyed O
his O
immune O
system O
” O
and O
“ O
poisoned O
” O
him O
beyond O
retrieval O
. O

Yes O
, O
that O
’s O
what O
I O
now O
predict O
that O
Adams O
will O
say O
after O
Gibb O
finally O
succumbs O
to O
his O
disease O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
although O
I’d O
love O
to O
see O
Gibb O
be O
a O
long O
term O
survivor O
of O
his O
cancer O
, O
I O
doubt O
we O
have O
that O
long O
to O
wait O
to O
find O
out O
if O
my O
prediction O
is O
correct O

Researcher O
are O

the O

without O
having O

The O
hormone O
in O
the O
pill O
is O
being O
called O
irisin O
and O
occurs O
naturally O
in O
the O
body O

According O
to O
the O
researchers O
, O
this O
hormone O
is O
found O
in O
normal O
muscle O
cells O

triggers O
the O
calorie O
burning O
effects O

Experts O
from O

found O
its O

supported O
the O
role O
of O
the O
CQC O
but O
believe O
it O
needs O
to O
improve O
. O

It O
is O
recommending O
a O
series O
of O
measures O
, O
including O
that O
the O
CQC O
sets O
a O
two O

target O
for O
responding O
to O
NHS O
staff O
who O
raise O
concerns O
about O
standards O
in O
their O
workplace O
. O

The O
regulator O
should O
also O
monitor O
and O
publish O
its O
success O
in O
meeting O
those O
targets O
and O
, O
if O
it O
cannot O
meet O
them O
, O
must O
look O
again O
at O
whether O
more O
staff O
are O
needed O
. O

The O
CQC O
has O
come O
in O
for O
heavy O
criticism O
in O
recent O
months O
, O
including O
over O
missed O
deadlines O
for O
registering O
health O
and O
social O

providers O
and O
falling O
numbers O
of O

. O

More O
than O
one O
in O
three O
nurses O
surveyed O
by O
the O
RCN O
( O
35 O

) O
said O
they O
did O
not O
believe O
the O
CQC O
sufficiently O
takes O
into O
account O
the O
importance O
of O
staffing O

on O
NHS O
wards O
, O
or O
the O
skills O

of O

. O

The O
RCN O
has O
repeatedly O
raised O
concerns O
about O
low O
staffing O
levels O
contributing O
to O
poor O
patient O
care O
, O
and O
how O

have O
changed O
the O
skills O
mix O
between O
numbers O
of O
fully O
qualified O
and O
unqualified O
staff O
. O

Many O
nurses O
in O
the O
survey O
also O
had O
concerns O
about O
the O
consistency O
of O
inspections O
across O
England O
, O
the O
RCN O
said O
. O

RCN O
chief O
executive O
Dr O
Peter O
Carter O
said O
: O
“ O
Having O
the O
right O
numbers O
and O
mix O
of O
healthcare O
professionals O
is O
pivotal O
to O
delivering O
high O
standards O
of O
patient O
care O
and O
outcomes O
. O

“ O
It O
is O
therefore O
very O
worrying O
that O
nurses O
feel O
that O
the O
CQC O
does O
not O
focus O
enough O
on O
staffing O
levels O
in O
hospitals O
and O
care O
homes O
, O
and O
has O
a O
lack O
of O
experienced O
staff O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
inspections O
. O

This O
clearly O
undermines O
the O
credibility O
of O
its O
work O
. O
” O
The O
RCN O
wants O
the O
CQC O
to O
report O
specifically O
on O
staffing O
levels O
during O
its O
inspections O
, O
including O
the O
ratio O
of O
registered O
nurses O
to O
other O
staff O
. O

It O
should O
also O
develop O
an O
appropriate O
tool O
to O
determine O
staffing O
levels O
and O
nurse O
to O
patient O
ratios O
, O
it O
said O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
CQC O
should O
also O
ensure O
all O
providers O
have O
an O
unannounced O
inspection O
once O
a O
year O
and O
inspectors O
should O
speak O
to O
staff O
– O
both O
junior O

senior O
– O
without O

present O
so O

freely O

The O
review O
proposes O
a O
model O
which O
places O

at O

Health O

social O
care O

will O
be O
increasingly O
accessible O
in O

will O
deal O
with O

will O
be O
at O
the O
centre O
of O
decision O
making O
about O

There O
will O
be O
a O
significant O
shift O
from O
provision O
of O
services O
in O
hospitals O
to O
provision O
of O
services O
in O

, O
where O
it O
is O
safe O

effective O

do O
this O

Services O
will O
regard O
home O

ensure O
that O

The O
review O
proposes O
hospitals O
will O
work O
as O
a O
system O
, O
with O

contributing O
to O
the O

of O
a O
total O
service O
to O
its O

This O
will O
mean O
change O
in O
all O
sites O
over O
a O
five O
year O
period O
. O

A O
key O
aspect O
of O
this O
approach O
is O
that O
critical O
clinical O
staff O
will O
be O
employed O
to O
work O
in O
a O
hospital O
system O
and O
will O
be O
a O
resource O
for O
each O
population O
working O
as O
necessary O
across O
hospital O
services O

The O
review O
envisages O
change O
at O
several O
of O
the O
current O
acute O

sites O
it O
suggests O
a O
likely O
position O

However O
, O
the O
key O
test O
for O
any O
future O
service O
configuration O
has O
to O
be O
sustainability O
and O
resilience O
in O
clinical O
terms O
. O

It O
will O
be O
on O

he O

At O
this O
point O
, O
whether O
Novartis O
can O
avoid O
a O
lengthy O

is O
very O
unclear O
. O

The O
problems O
the O
FDA O
cited O
in O
the O
inspection O
report O
were O
so O
disturbing O
that O
the O
agency O
used O
capital O
letters O
and O
a O
bold O
font O
to O
emphasize O
that O
a O
pattern O
of O
problems O
existed O
. O

These O
problems O
included O
failures O
to O
respond O
to O
consumer O
complaints O
about O
bottles O
containing O
incorrect O
tablets O
, O
file O
reports O
with O
the O
FDA O
or O
send O
postage O
paid O
materials O
to O
consumers O
so O
that O
further O
evidence O
could O
be O
examined O
( O
here O
is O
the O
FDA O
report O
) O
. O

The O
drugmaker O
did O
not O
help O
it O
cause O
by O
insisting O
the O
problems O
were O
beyond O
its O
control O
, O
even O
though O
the O
FDA O
noted O
plant O
personnel O
failed O
to O
properly O
investigate O
many O
complaints O
and O
could O
not O
present O
any O
evidence O
to O
justify O
its O
conclusion O
. O

Moreover O
, O
the O
shutdown O
and O
subsequent O
recall O
came O
shortly O
after O
the O
FDA O
sent O
a O
warning O
letter O
to O
Novartis O
about O
manufacturing O
problems O
at O
three O
plants O
run O
by O
its O
Sandoz O
generic O
drug O
unit O
( O
look O
here O
) O
. O

It O
’s O
hard O
to O
avoid O
the O
conclusion O
that O
the O
FDA O
is O
searching O
for O
system O
issues O
and O
still O
other O
plants O
are O
going O
to O
be O
scrutinized O
. O

The O
worst O
case O
scenario O
is O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
a O
lengthy O
shutdown O
and O
possibly O
still O
more O
, O
depending O
upon O
how O
the O
FDA O
proceeds O
. O

Then O
there O
is O
the O
prospect O
of O
a O
consent O
decree O
. O

Remember O
that O
the O
FDA O
has O
pursued O
this O
step O
recently O
with O
Johnson O
& O
Johnson O
and O
Genzyme O
, O
and O
Wall O
Street O
is O
speculating O
that O
Hospira O
is O
up O
next O
( O
more O
here O
) O
. O

No O
one O
has O
suggested O
it O
may O
come O
to O
this O
, O
but O
the O
sort O
of O
problems O
that O
Novartis O
has O
caused O
and O
FDA O
interest O
in O
multiple O
plants O
make O
it O
likely O
the O
drugmaker O
will O
be O
preoccupied O
with O
manufacturing O
issues O
for O
quite O
some O
time O
. O

And O
sales O
would O
have O
