Jeffrey O

Our O

that O

' O
' O
From O

perspective O
, O
India B-LOC
was O
a O
major O
source O
of O
the O
international O
spread O
of O
wild O

over O

decades O
… O

, O
also O
, O
there O
is O
no O
longer O
an O
excuse O
that O

cannot O
be O
eradicated O
. O

it O
can O

it O
can O

Dr O

' O
' O
The O

that O

Now O
very O

they O
are O
really O
looking O
at O

within O

' O

Just O
two O
years O

, O
experts O
were O
stating O
polio B-DIS
could O
never O
be O
eradicated O
from O
India B-LOC

In O
2009 O
, O
India B-LOC
accounted O
for O
half O
the O
world O
' O
s O
polio B-DIS
cases O
with O
741 O

The O
country O
is O
an O
ideal O
breeding O

for O
the O

with O
a O

' O

assistant O

Bruce O

the O

India B-LOC
moving O
towards O
being O
declared O

three O
years O
without O
an O

' O
' O
is O
a O
huge O
milestone O
which O
almost O
can O
' O
t O
be O
overstated O
' O
' O
. O

But O
he O
said O
the O
remaining O
endemic O
countries O
faced O
different O
challenges O
to O
India B-LOC
. O

In O
Nigeria O
, O
there O
remain O
pockets O
of O
resistance O
to O
the O
vaccine O
, O
in O
the O
belief O
it O
causes O
infertility O
, O
while O
the O
violence O
in O
Afghanistan O

Pakistan O
means O
vaccinators O
can O
' O
t O
safely O
get O
to O
children O
, O
particularly O
those O
who O
live O
in O
restive O
border O
areas O
. O

But O
Dr O

said O
another O
country O

perhaps O
another O

could O
be O

Unemployed O

Alexis O

his O

what O

“ O
I O
almost O
had O
an O

” O
said O
Rodriguez O
, O
28 O
, O
just O
one O
of O
several O
hundred O
patients O
to O
receive O
absurdly O
inflated O

a O

” O
His O
amount O

was O

that O
in O
reality O
amounted O
to O
no O
more O
than O
$ O
300 O

Initially O
, O
Rodriguez O
panicked O
because O
he O
had O
spent O
three O
weeks O
in O
the O
hospital O
with O
pneumonia B-DIS
in O
the O
spring O
and O
knew O
he O
had O
to O
pay O
part O
of O
the O
$ O
40,000 O
cost O
. O

But O
he O
quickly O
realized O
the O
terrifying O
invoice O
couldn’t O
be O
right O
. O

He O
called O
the O
billing O

found O
out O

the O
only O
one O
with O

The O

said O
it O

: O

that O

put O

“ O

“ O
I O

“ O

afford O

which O
consists O

Moreover O
, O
the O
price O

as O
this O
substance O
is O
isolated O
from O
sweet O

( O
Artemisia O
annua O
) O
which O
grows O
mainly O
in O
China O
and O
Vietnam O
, O
and O
varies O
seasonally O
in O
its O
availability O
. O

To O
make O
the O
drug O
affordable O
for O
at O

some O
patients O
in O
developing B-LOC
countries I-LOC
, O
the O
Clinton O
Foundation O
, O
for O

, O
subsidises O
its O
cost O
to O
the O
tune O
of O
several O
million O
dollars O
per O
year O

Nevertheless O
, O
over O
one O
million O
people O
die O
of O

each O

because O
they O
do O
not O
have O
